I am looking forward to getting to meet you on Jan 22.\n","\n","The purpose of this homework is to get to know you better and warm up your Python skills before we go deeper, plus to get you started in thinking data-analytically.  **Please complete Parts 1 and 2 by the first day of class, and Parts 3 and 4 by Thursday Jan 25 @ midnight.**  You should submit your .ipynb file via Brightspace by the Thursday deadline - this HW will be graded on completion only.  \n","\n","As noted in the Syllabus, this class is intended for those who already know python.  We have created a few notebooks for you to go through to make sure you are at the right level.\n","\n","In class we will be using Google Colab as our Python development environment.  For those not familiar with Colab, it is a cloud-based IDE that makes it easy to share notebooks and data and work jointly with others.  Some of you may use other IDEs (Jupyter, VSCode,  Anaconda Spyder, or other) – that is fine – most of these systems are very similar notebook-based environments.     However, all of the examples in class and homeworks will be done using Colab, so it will be good to be familiar with it.  \n","\n","This Pre-Work assigment is made up of three parts and will not be graded.\n","\n","**Part 1**:   To get a refresher on Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python basics, walk through the following notebooks and the links therein.
