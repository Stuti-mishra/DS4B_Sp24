Today, one of the models we will be using is a logistic regression. From the previous classes, we have seen that logistic regression requires *all* fields to be numerical. So, we are going to create \"dummy\" variables for all the fields that are categorical (same as you did for your homework).  [I believe in sklearn all models require numeric variables; that's not the case for every implementation.]\n","\n","#### Dummyize\n","A dummy variable is a binary variable corresponding to one value of a categorical variable.\n","The typical way to create dummies for a field is to create new variables for each possible category of the field. For example consider a field called color that can have the possible values \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\". To dummyize color, we would create three new features: \"color_red\", \"color_blue\", and \"color_green\". These fields would take the value 1 or 0 depending on the actual value of color. Each record can only have one of these fields set to 1.\n","\n","Notes:\n","\n","- You can also leave out one of the possible categories. For example, in the above example that had three possible values, you can create only two dummies. This, because when \"color_red\"=0 and \"color_blue\"=0 it means that \"color_green=1\".  Often all three dummies are created anyway; it is slightly redundant, but makes the models more comprehensible.\n","\n","- There also are cases where non-numeric variables can take on multiple values (for example, `colors = {red, white, blue}`).  In these cases again often binary variables are created for each value, the obvious difference being that now more than one can be non-zero (and you would need to represent all the values).\n","\n","\n","So.

However, our models *are* scoring models (e.g., class-probability estimation models).  So the confusion matrices are defined with respect a scoring model plus some decision logic -- when would you take one action versus another.  The most common decision logic is a *threshold* on the score.  The threshold should be chosen carefully, and with the business need in mind.   For binary classes, the default built in to most modeling *programs* when they return a predicted classification is to use a threshold corresponding to an estimated class probability of 0.5.  This is because the modeling program does not know the business setting, and 0.5 makes sense as a default (in expectation it gives the maximum classification accuracy, if the probabilities are well calibrated).  **However, 0.5 probably is not the right threshold for any particular problem.**\n","\n","So let's start with the default of predicting a 1 if the estimated probability is $\\geq$ 50% and a 0 otherwise.\n","\n","Remember, a confusion matrix looks like:\n","\n","```\n","  |____________ p __________|___________ n ___________|\n","Y |   1's above threshold   |   0's above threshold   |\n","N |   1's below threshold   |   0's below threshold   |\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"t9Z6nZYGLvN2","scrolled":false},"source":["# Split our data into training and test sets\n","X = data.drop(['class'], axis=1)\n","Y = data['class']\n","X_mailing_train, X_mailing_test, Y_mailing_train, Y_mailing_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=.25, random_state=42)\n","\n","# Make and fit a model on the training data\n","model_mailing = LogisticRegression(C=1000000, solver='liblinear')\n","model_mailing.fit(X_mailing_train, Y_mailing_train)\n","\n","# Get probabilities of being a donor (We saw this in a prior class)\n","probabilities = model_mailing.predict_proba(X_mailing_test)[:, 1]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UjrfsirxLvOA"},"source":["Use the default threshold of 50% to decide Y vs N.\n","\n","(An individual below this threshold will get a prediction of \"0\" and someone above this will get a prediction of \"1\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_LampQbELvOD","scrolled":false},"source":["prediction = probabilities > 0.5\n","\n","# Build and print a confusion matrix\n","confusion_matrix_50 = pd.DataFrame(metrics.confusion_matrix(Y_mailing_test, prediction, labels=[1, 0]).T,\n","                                columns=['p', 'n'], index=['Y', 'N'])\n","print (confusion_matrix_50)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ztIEkLytLvOL"},"source":["Wait -- take a close look at that.

Let's use a version of that example here:\n","\n","- Target: `Y = 1`\n","- Three features: \"earning\", \"geographic\", and \"experience\".\n","\n","Up until this point, when we need a \"single number metric\" for generalization performance, we have been using \"vanilla\" classification accuracy (the number of records correctly classified divided by the total number of records). However, classification accuracy usually does not  give us the \"best\" interpretation of our model's performance for a particular business problem. An more general evaluation is to visualize and measure the performance of a model using the Reciever Operating Characteristic **(ROC) curve**.\n","\n","Let's first specify how we create ROC curves: For each threshold $t$ that is chosen, we can define two quantities. First, the false positive rate, $FPR = \\frac{False Positives}{False Positives+True Negatives}$, and second, the true positive rate, $TPR = \\frac{True Positives}{True Positives+False Negatives}$. The ROC curve is the result of plotting $FPR$ against $TPR$ for each value of $t$ that is possible in the data.  It helps us to visualize and analyze the trade-offs between the opportunity for benefits (via true positives) and the possibility of costs (via false positives).\n","\n","\" The lower left point **(0, 0) represents the strategy of never issuing a positive classification**; such a classifier commits no false positive errors but also gains no true positives. The opposite strategy, of unconditionally issuing positive classifications, is represented by the upper right point (1, 1). The point **(0, 1) represents perfect classification** (the star in Figure 8-3). The diagonal line connecting (0, 0) to (1, 1) represents the policy of guessing a class (for example, by flipping a weighted coin). \"  \n","\n","- _Provost, Foster, and Tom Fawcett.
